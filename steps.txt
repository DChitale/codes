HOW TO RUN JAVA RMI APPLICATION
========================================

STEP 1: Compile all Java files
-------------------------------
javac CalculatorInterface.java
javac CalculatorImpl.java
javac Server.java
javac Client.java

OR compile all at once:
javac *.java


STEP 2: Start the Server
-------------------------
java Server

You should see:
- "Starting RMI Registry on port 1099..."
- "Creating Calculator remote object..."
- "Server is ready and waiting for client requests..."
- "Calculator service bound to: rmi://localhost:1099/CalculatorService"

Keep this terminal/command prompt window open!


STEP 3: Run the Client (in a NEW terminal/command prompt)
----------------------------------------------------------
Open a NEW terminal/command prompt window
Navigate to the same directory
Run: java Client

You should see the client performing calculations:
- "Looking up Calculator service..."
- "Successfully connected to Calculator service!"
- Results of add, subtract, multiply, and divide operations


TROUBLESHOOTING:
----------------
1. If you get "Connection refused":
   - Make sure the Server is running first
   - Check that port 1099 is not blocked by firewall

2. If you get "ClassNotFoundException":
   - Make sure all files are compiled
   - Run from the correct directory

3. If you get "AlreadyBoundException":
   - The server is already running
   - Stop the previous server instance first

4. To stop the server:
   - Press Ctrl+C in the server terminal


FILE STRUCTURE:
---------------
1. CalculatorInterface.java - Remote interface (defines contract)
2. CalculatorImpl.java - Implementation (business logic)
3. Server.java - Server setup (creates registry and binds object)
4. Client.java - Client application (uses remote object)


NOTES:
------
- Server must be started before Client
- Both must run on the same machine (localhost) or update the URL
- Default RMI registry port is 1099
- The service name is "CalculatorService"
